# Pre-Cache Maps

Download & pre-cache maps when in a server before the map actually changes to speed up moving between maps!

Works like this:

- While in a server, check the list of maps on the server.
- If there are any new maps, get the game to download and cache the map.
- When the timer nears 0, also check again (to help with RMT style map changing).
- Then, when the server changes map, you don't need to download the map from the server because you already have it.
- Boom! Instant map changes.
